Projects
•	Project: TTS (Text-to-Speech) using YouTube Video Scraping
In this project, I developed a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model by scraping YouTube videos. 
The process included several key steps:
YouTube Video Scraping: I used the PyTube library to scrape YouTube videos based on titles. The objective was to extract the audio data from these videos for further processing.
Audio Conversion: After scraping the YouTube videos, I converted them into WAV files using the PyDub library. These audio files serve as the input for training the TTS model.
TTS Model Training: I utilized the WAV audio files to train a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The goal was to develop a system that, when given Arabic text, can generate the corresponding speech in Arabic.
•	Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification : brain tumor segmentation and classification for Glioma MRI images using Transformer and Res-Net deep learning Model.
•	ChatGLM2 A chat-bot using GLM (General Language Model) that answers questions in Chinese Language.
•	Chinese Traffic Sign Classification: classify Chinese traffic signs using machine learning techniques. 
•	Chinese MNIST Image Classifier: classifying Chinese characters using a convolution neural network (CNN) using Python
•	Naive Bayes SMS Spam Detection
•	RNN Hugging Face GPT-2: Code generation is the process of automatically generating code from a set of input data or instruction 
•	RNN BERT transformers :Classify the positive reviews and the negative ones.
